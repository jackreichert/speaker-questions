# Speaker Questions

This tool was created to facilitate real-time moderation for Q/A sessions in conferences


## Getting Started

1. After enabling go to the plugin settings: `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=speaker_question&page=settings` and select a home for your Q/A
2. Set up "sessions" -- each session will group questions asked to that session.
3. Go to the plugin base page and select a session... ask a question
4. Append `/moderate` to the end of the session page. If you're logged in you'll see all the questions asked.
5. Try opening up that page in another window and reorder/star/hide... it happens real-time.
